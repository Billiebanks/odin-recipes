# odin-recipes
I will create a webpage listing recipes. 
In this file I will demonstrate basic html skills including the following funnctions:
Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, both ordered and unordered, inserting images from both relative sources and absolute sources and including alt text, creating bold and italic text using 'srong' and 'em' elements, and links.
